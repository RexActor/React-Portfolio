        <div className=""></div>
        I'm self-taught C# software developer who want's to learn and develop
        new skills. With Front-end Development Bootcamp I'm planning to excel my
        career in tech industry. I'm eager to learn and I'm ready to invest my
        time in learning to be able to become more experienced. My experience in
        procurement, where I have 7 years experience, should and will help me
        with different thinking and different approach. In procurement I learned
        how to solve problems quickly and efficiently and prioritize things.
